# Decision-Tree
Building Decision Tree model with given training data employing ID3 algorithm to make decisions for new instances using Python Programming (NumPy)


Decision tree Learning

Decision tree learning is a classification scheme that generates a tree and set of rules from the given data set. It uses a decision tree as a predictive model that maps observations about an item (attribute values, represented in the branches) to conclusions about the items target value (represented in the leaves).

Decision tree learning is one of the most widely used and practical meth- ods for predictive modeling machine learning. ”The classical decision tree algorithms have been around for decades and they provide a foundation for modern variations like Bagging decision trees, Boosted decision trees, Ran- dom forest, Rotation forest which are among the most powerful techniques available.”


Decision tree algorithms are also known by their modern name CART algorithms, which stand for Classification And Regression Trees.

• ”In Classification trees, the target attribute can take a finite set of target values.

• In Regression trees, the target attribute can take continuous values that are real numbers.”

The set of records available for building the decision tree is divided into two disjoint subsets - Training set and Test set.

• Training set is used to build the decision tree. This data is labeled, i.e. the data is tagged with correct output.

• Test set is used to test the decision tree if it gives the correct classification. This data is also labeled but the target output is hidden and checks whether the tree gives the same output classification as in the data.
